    "\n",
    "The modulus should be close to the difference from the longest string with k. This number is the number of strings that will be stored in the hash table. Since probing resolution technique works better when the load factor is no more than 80%, I am dividing this number by 75% to gain an estimated size of the hash table that is of a good side for efficient hashing. Since modulus choice should be a prime number for more distributed hashing, I find the closest prime number that is higher then the current proposed size of the hash table. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the base of the hash value is 10, there is a limited range in which the computed hash value prior to modulus division occurs. For instance, if k=3, then, based on the hash function, the values will be in almost all cases below 10,000 = $10^{(k+1)}$. If the size of the string is very large - 100,003 symbols which will result in 100,000/0.75 potential strings. If we chose the size close to the size of the string, then the indices calculated will be within the only first 10,000 (because $\\frac{10,000}{100,000} = 10,000$ for any value instead of 10,000 which is smaller than the denominator. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, even though the hash size allows to store approximately 133,333 spots, but the indices will be only in the first 10,000. The load factor remains low but the collisions will happen very often in the 10,000 indices only. Therefore, if the number of potential strings is much higher than the approximate upper bound of the indices value, I decided to implement a chaining technique instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm manages this choice in the way that I explained above. \n",

    "### The Selection of Modulus Value\n",
    "\n",
    "I am using the algorithm by Sieve of Sundaram to calculate the prime values and then use binary search to find the closest value that is higher than the initial proposed size of the hash table, if the size of the hash table is bigger than 10^4 - the upper bound of the list of prime values, the largest one is selected and then chaining technique is chosen instead if the load will be high to resolve the collisions. \n",

    "Let len(x) = n and len(y) = m\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first helper function called is the string preformatting converting the inputs to only lowercase string with alphabetic values. It has the complexity of the input size, therefore, the complexity is $\\Theta(n+m )$. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The time complexity of the mod_calculator() function is $\\Theta(n log n )$ because of the Sieve's algorithm being O(n log n) and binary search of O(log n). N would be the size of x and the size of the hash function. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The initialization of the hash function is proportional to the input of X. Asymptotically, the complexity should be $\\Theta(n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Next is the for loop to build the has table which runs over the substrings of x. Therefore, it has a complexity of $\\Theta(n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The function to convert the string to the integer runs in constant time \n",
    "\n",
    "6. The function to push the string to the hash table is a constant runtime, assuming that there are few collisions. Based on the performance of the elements per bucket, this assumption can be put in place and simplified to $O(1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The next part of the code is the lookup - it also includes a for loop. Therefore, the complexity is $\\Theta(m)$\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The function to convert the string to the integer runs in constant time \n",
    "\n",
    "9. The lookup is proportinal to the load factor a which is the nummber of elements in y and the size of the hash table. $\\Theta(1+ a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining all these steps, the complexity should be $\\Theta(n log n + m )$. The algorithm can be improved to only\n",
    "$\\Theta(n + m )$ if the primary number function is replaced by a database or a faster technique. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is efficient and the fast runtime on the large input proves that. "

Then, I scale them down to the size of the list and receive an index of the hash table. \n",

    "1. The first helper function called is the string preformatting converting the inputs to only lowercase string with alphabetic values. It has the complexity of the input size, therefore, the complexity is $\\Theta(n+m )$. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The time complexity of the mod_calculator() function is $\\Theta(n log n )$ because of the Sieve's algorithm being O(n log n) and binary search of O(log n). N would be the size of x and the size of the hash function. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The initialization of the hash function is proportional to the input of X. Asymptotically, the complexity should be $\\Theta(n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Next is the for loop to build the has table which runs over the substrings of x. Therefore, it has a complexity of $\\Theta(n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The function to convert the string to the integer runs in constant time \n",
    "\n",
    "6. The function to compute the hash function also runs in constant time with possible deviations in 5% of the time when the value outside of the hash table size list is obtained. Then it is replaced by another value. (These results were obtained experimentally).  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. The function to push the string to the hash table is a constant runtime, assuming that there are few collisions. Based on the performance of the elements per bucket, this assumption can be put in place and simplified to $O(1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The next part of the code is the lookup - it also includes a for-loop. Therefore, the complexity is $\\Theta(m)$\n",

    "\n",
    "I would run this code on longer substrings of different lengths, but the implementation depends on the goal. If we want to find the full copies of the paragraphs of the text, then very long strings should be used. If we look for specific phrases, then the k should be of the approximate size of the average phrase. This should be computed analytically by running the experiments because there is a trade-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this code outputs the pairs of the matching indices, if the k is too short, then it will output too many pairs of strings that might just be words or typical collocations in this topic: such as \"hash function\". It will probably be used in every students' assignment on hash function. However, too long k (for example of the length of the sentence) might miss the parts of the sentences that were copied. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the correct length should be identified based on the type of X and Y. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I would multiply the number of the tuples in the output by k to see the total copied length. Then, I would compare this length to the lengths of x and y and would calculate the proportion of the copied work. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the size of k, the percentages should be treated differently. If we chose k of an approximate size of the sentence and the input is a 10-page paper, even 5-10% of plagiarism could be worrisome. But if k is smaller, this could happen because of the quotes, definitions, or common jargon specific to the paper. Therefore, the user should be informed about these trade-offs to make the right conclusion from the report. The algorithm could even analyze the input of k and provide a brief summary of whether this 5-10% of plagiarism is serious or not. \n",

    "\n",
    "The algorithms are tested on a big input and their performance for different \"k\"s are evaluated. Since the algorithm is deterministic and the inputs are the same, the differences in runtime depend only on the implementation itseld. As we can see, the implementations are very similar. Some of the spikes happen for both of the algorithms which might happen when the collision happened and either probing or chaining was used to find the correct value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second algorithm with multiplication hashing should hash a bit slower in terms of the implementation but because its distribution across the hash table and little collisions, the spikes happen less often and the general trend is that the value of the running time is just a bit lower than the rolling hashing. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "optimization - when investigating the extent of the algorithm, the choice of the k should be optimized to maximize the finding of the plagiarism without the noise and with effective computational power. Variables of change are the sphere of the paper (is it a unique work or work that will have many repetitive words across inputs) and the size of k. The fixed constraints are the size of the paper and the efficiency of the algorithm. An algorithm is proposed to ask user of an input type how likely will there be repetitive words in the paper) and how they want to analyze the paper - based on words, sentences, or phrases - this is the size of k. The algorithm then calculates the given percentage and outputs the guide on how likely this resemblance is due to noise or actually plagiarism. This information is enough to provide the global solution - either by changing the input parameters or by accepting the percentage of plagiarism solution. \n",

    "selfawareness  - with the end of the semester and much work on finals, I needed to develop the strategy to complete all my assignments before a strict deadline. Based on the information I learned in freshman year about the better concentration and creative thinking setups and my experience under the large workload, I have developed a strategy. I have allocated the most time to this assignment - 3 days - because previous experience showed that I work best with breaks several days in a row, since brainstorming and developing code requires much concentration from me and if I am working for more than 6 hours straight, I usually fall for some pitfall and get stuck in some bug for a really long time. However, on the next day, I always manage to solve the bug fast. More than that, I split the types of work based on my mood - when I am more happy, I select more creative work as developing but when my mood is down and it is really hard to make myself do work, I write justification, explanations, format the code, write the HCs. This is based on the matecogonition. More than that, this is a persuasion technique for me on when I want to procrastinate instead of doing work. I already know I am not in the best mood and do not have a strong desire to do my assignments, and writing work is not hard for me so it is much easier for me to make myself complete my work. Justifying to myself that I am in a mood that is a great fit for this type of work is the technique I have found to be working the best for.\n",

    "rightproblem - for the choice of the hash function for the second part of the algorithm, I framed with problem, and it helped me to arrive at an optimal solution. Since I was not using the division method anymore, I started research multiple hashing techniques, keeping in mind the purposes - making a better distribution of values accross the ahs table so the more slower hash function could still compete with a fast rolling hashing, very suitable for plagiarism problem. The scope of my problem was defined at the local level of the algorithm but would affect the total performance. The obstacle I had was my limited knowledge of the other hashing functions and their applicability to my specific function as compared to the rolling hashing. Therefore, I have selected several hashing methods I liked and ran them in my algorithm to see the elements per bucket distribution. The adapted multiplication method sorted on average a load of 2 elements per bucket and it outperformed the other candidate - the trivial hash function with the string converted to integer being the only operation and the mid squares. You can see the code for the multiplicative method in the notebook. As a result, I have selected the most efficient function and compared it to the rolling hashing. Even though the function is slower, both of them perform similarly - so its bucketing is more efficient than the rolling hash. As a result, the choice of the algorithm has helped me to achieve my goal. \n",

    "In the beginning of the semester, I was not sure how to apply the HCs and LOs to the code because it was new. As I was gaining more experience and received very helpful feedback throughout the semester with the pre-class work submissions, I have learned which repetitive mistakes I was making and which points  I was not referencing to get a higher score. Through the interactive applied learning, I hope now I code better. "
