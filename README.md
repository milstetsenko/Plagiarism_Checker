# Plagiarism_Checker
This project includes a plagiarism checker using hard-coded rolling hashing and Karp-Rabin algorithm


I have compared several methods of hashing: rolling hashing, multiplication hashing, etc. to derive the best performance algorithm for checking the overlap in the two input strings. The result of the comparison shows that rolling  algorithm works the most efficinelty, therefore, it is the algorithm that should be used in the project.
